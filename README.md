# Eye Rods Simulation
This is a basic but very realistic simulation of what I see while meditating and concentrating on my vision process in a dimly light room.

After many hours of research, I can only find "information" about saying that it is "impossible" to see your eyes cones or rods. However, I have come to the conclusion that what I see cannot be anything else. What I see is a constellation of features which does not change over time (persistent over weeks and months), therefore it has to be part of my eye structure... hence not my imagination or any sorts of optical illusion or hallucination.

Please feel free to comment (especially if you ever had experienced the same thing) or debunk this, so far I have yet to find a better explanation.


# Free and Open Source
It is free for you to download and modify it any way you like or re-use it.
A build is accessible in the .zip file in the root for your convenience.

# Features
- Particle (eye rod or cone) simulation using a simple oscillator around a fixed point.
- Intensity modulated by the exponential of the inverse oscillation amplitude (the smaller the amplitude, the higher the intensity)
- The number of particles is fixed at start with randomized positions generating a noticeable "constellations" of oscillating particles, this is to imitate the nature of the eye rods/cones distribution which is fixed.
- The particles are generally blurry until their vibrations oscillate only moderately around the origin, generating enough intensity to be visible, effectively making them somewhat flash-in (focused) and out of view (blurry).
